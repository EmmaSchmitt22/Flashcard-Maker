# Flashcard-Maker


Project summary: A project for adding custom flashcards to a deck and dynamically interacting with them by flipping them over. 

Key features and functionality: The program will validate the user's entry and push an error if there is no text submitted, then prompt the user to enter a question/answer. Once added, the user can dynamically look through their flashcards by toggling them to flipped or not flipped, in order to study the contents. 

Instructions for use: Fill in your complete question and answer, then select "add to deck" to add the card to your flashcard collection. Flashcards can be clicked on to study. There is currently no option to remove a card, but, if you make an error or would like to restart, you can refresh the page.
